GENRE - Top Down Scrolling Shooter

NAME - Assault on the Death Star

Gameplay is based off the Star Wars series. The player will travel through space towards the Death Star and then along the Death Star's face when approaching the vulnerable thermal exhaust. A direct hit on the thermal exhaust will destroy the death star. A vengeful villain then arrives, serving as the final boss.

Each stage will have a very large image background which will move down the visible screen at a set speed, giving the allusion of movement over terrain. The playerâ€™s image of a spaceship will have movement limited to the visible screen, which of course is done by altering the x and y coordinates of the spaceship image based on compressed keys. Enemy units will have basic movements, but a combination of linear, jagged, and sinusoidal enemies can produce complicated situations.

GOAL - navigate through space, destroy the death star, and beat the final boss.

MECHANICS - intuitive controls will be used: arrow keys for UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and SPACE BAR to fire bullets.

DIFFERENT LEVELS - there will be multiple stages making up the approach the Death Star's exhaust, each with different obstacles and defensive drones to fight. Some enemies will drop buffs for the player to use. The second-to-last level will be a fast-paced trick shot, where the player is given one shot to hit the exhaust pipe. Finally, the boss will absorb many hits and have more difficult attacks to dodge.

CHEAT CODES - codes will be available for additional lives and toggle-able invulnerability.
